Since Android 6 (Marshmallow) is not possible anymore to clear cache of all apps at same time and Google has moved this permission to system apps only. There is only one possible way left - open manually info about application and find specific "Storage" menu and then press "Clean cache" button.

<i>AndroidCacheCleaner</i> can request all installed user and system apps and it replaces all manual actions related to clean cache using Accessibility service. <i>AndroidCacheCleaner</i> saves the last checked apps to show them next time only.

<br><b>How to use</b>

* Run the app
* Open Accessibility Settings
* Enable Accessibility support for AppCacheCleaner
* Return back to AppCacheCleaner app
* Click User Apps Cache, System Apps Cache OR All Apps Cache
* Check required apps (use floating button to check/uncheck all apps)
* Press Clean Cache floating button
* Press Accessibility button to interrupt process OR wait until process will be finished
* Press Close App OR clean app from task manager to disable Accessibility

<b>Note:</b> All checked apps will be saved into permanent list after clicking Clean Cache and they will show up as checked next time.
